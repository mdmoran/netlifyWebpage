        <h2>Who am I exactly?</h2>
        
  
        
        <p>
            I am a student at Kansas State Polytechnic University in Salina studying Computer Systems Technology. This webpage is actually an assignment of mine. I thought I'd just put a couple things about me on here. Let's begin then!
        </p>
    
        <h3>I've Got the Formalities, What Kind of Person Are You?</h3>
        <p>
           Well, you know I made this website and am studying computers, so you have probably picked up that I am a bit of a nerd. I enjoy playing computer games as well as board/card games such as Dungeons and Dragons (of which I actually produce a Podcast) and Magic: The Gathering. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>So You Work With Computers? What Have You Done?</h3>
        <p>
           To this day I have already designed a website using HTML5/CSS for my podcast(mentioned above), created a game using JavaScript, and worked a little bit with Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Currently, I am in the process of improving my skills with those and learning Python and C.

            Brackets will open a <em>live connection</em> to your local browser and push HTML and CSS updates as you
            type! You might already be doing something like this today with browser-based tools, but with Brackets
            there is no need to copy and paste the final code back into the editor. Your code runs in the
            browser, but lives in your editor!
